# Automatic-machine-fault-detection-from-Acoustic-Data-using-Deep-Learning
Automatic Machine Fault Detection system using Deep Learning on Acoustic Data. Identifies four fault types: Arcing, Corona, Looseness, and Tracking. Uses Mel Spectrogram images from audio data and a CNN model for classification. Achieves high accuracy with clear performance visualization via Confusion Matrix.
